# Sweave Compiling and Running instructions:

Once in R studio open up "Shiny_App_Sweave.Rnw" , and when the code is present make sure that in the bottom right panel of r studio that the "Graphs" Folder is selected since the sweave needs all the pictures and graphs stored in that folder in order to run.The "Graphs" Folder must be present as a subfolder of the "Sweave"  folder for it to work.
Once "Graphs" is selected, go to the top left panel of R studio click on the "Run" button then "Run All" and then to the left of the "Run" button click on "Compile PDF".
Enjoy!
